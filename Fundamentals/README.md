## Fundamentals Pillars

Common attributes of all good developers.

1. Can learn new things quickly.

2. Reuses code when possible.

   a. This means frameworks and libraries

3. Can abstract a hard process / problem into manageable parts.

4. Does not over-engineer.

  a. Does not write an application when a bash command will suffice

  b. Does not create abstractions or generalizations until necessary.

5. Writes software that is easy to maintain.

  a. Code is commented.

  b. Code is clean and self documenting.

  c. Code is modular and easy to understand. (ie. well-architected)

  d. Good code should read like a book.

  e. DRY

  f. One Responsibility Principle

6. Writes software that is bug-free and considers all edge-cases.

  a. Can write effective tests for software and understands the importance of up-time

  b. Uses feature flags, staged rollouts, and quality assurance to avoid outages

7. Writes software that is efficient.

  a. Has a reasonable understanding of algorithms and run-time complexity.

  b. Understands how computers work on a fundamental level and where efficiency bottlenecks are ( accessing memory takes longer than computation, types of memory, how much data you can reasonably store in memory, etc. )

8. Writes software that is resillient.

  a. Software should consider its upstream dependencies and fail gracefully when they are not met.

9. Writes software that is secure.

10. Picks the right tool (language / framework) for the job, or can adapt to the tools at hand.

  a. Best practices in Java are not best practices in Go

11. Can understand and fix bad code.
